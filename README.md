Preferences
I've been reading Michael Lewis' "The Undoing Project", and I was really interested in Amos Tversky's investigation of transitivity in consumer preferences. Since this tied in quite nicely to microeconomic theory and behavioral economics, I got the idea to write a quick program to test transitive preferencecs and consumer rationality. The test is based off of Tversky's 'hot drinks' questions. It's feasible for an individual's preferences to be intransitive, and therefore irrational. I had fun mapping out the decision tree and determining which outcomes were 'rational.'
